\subsection{Detailed Description}
\hyperlink{program_8hpp_source}{program.\-hpp}

Created on\-: Apr 8, 2013 Last Update\-: Apr 21, 2013 Orig. Author\-: Wade Burch (\href{mailto:nolnoch@cs.utexas.edu}{\tt nolnoch@cs.\-utexas.\-edu}) Contributors\-: \mbox{[}none\mbox{]}

This class was created to automate (and generally make easier) the use of G\-L\-S\-L programs through the G\-L\-E\-W extension libraries.

Notes\-:

You may call add\-Shader for every file you want to attach to each program, and all will be processed and used for that program's lifespan. Create multiple programs to separate your shaders for modular loading and use.

The construction and usage of the program is managed in sequence-\/ protected stages. Error messages will be printed if functions are called out of order. The correct order is\-: \begin{DoxyVerb}  addShader()         // as many as you need
  init()              // called once
  [bindAttribute()]   // only if you wish, for VAO/VBOs
  linkAndValidate()   // must be run before using program
  addSampler()        // called after program is linked for safety
  enable()            // to actually use
  disable()           // when you're done
\end{DoxyVerb}


At the moment, the samplers may only be specified when calling set\-Texure() by remembering the order in which you added them with add\-Sampler().

This is a work in progress and will be continually improved as I use it.
